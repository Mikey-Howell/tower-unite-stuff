			<h2>This is a TU inventory viewing website</h2><br>
			This was formally known as Plaza Stats until we were told that Pixeltail were going to be making a similar site.<br>
			This is a heavy alpha version, with very simple layouts. Be warned that not everything works.<br><br>
			Enter a SteamID64 or a vanity URL to search. The user must have a public profile.<br>
			<form id="SearchForm">
				<input type="search" id="LoadProfile">
				<input type="submit" id="SubmitSearch" value="Show Profile">
			</form>
			<br>

			If anyone wishes to help continue this, feel free to PM me, although keep in mind Pixeltail will proberbly obsolete this at some point.
